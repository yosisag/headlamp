Defined in: [lib/k8s/leaderWorkerSet.ts:28](https://github.com/Rucha0901/headlamp/blob/f19a5d7375f3a4adafc52bb2b8999455ae4eeca5/frontend/src/lib/k8s/leaderWorkerSet.ts#L28)

Label the leader worker set controller stamps on every stateful set and pod it
creates for a leader worker set, set to the leader worker set's name. Owner
references can't stand in for it: a group's worker stateful set is owned by
that group's leader pod rather than by the leader worker set.
